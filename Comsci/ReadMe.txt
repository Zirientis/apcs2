1. Introduction
Welcome to Comsci! Comsci is a turn-based dungeon game. To get started, simply
extract the archive and run the Comsci.exe executable file. The game will start
and prompt you to begin.

2. How-to
As of Build 0.1alpha, a new game will start automatically upon launching the
application. When prompted to place your player, select an open square and
left-click it to start your player there. When prompted to move, a blue outline
will surround the player whose turn it is to move. Select an adjacent square to
move to it. You will automatically pick up any collectible items on that square
and fight any monster located there.

3. Score
Score is attained by defeating monsters and collecting coins, potions, and
other items. One point is lost at the start of each turn. Certain game-modes
may have other specific score rules.

4. Game-modes
As of Build 0.1alpha, the implemented game mode is Spider Onslaught!, where you
try to maximize your score while fighting of a horde of spiders! You are given
three player characters, and must fight to achieve the maximum possible total
score. Classic mode is coming soon!

5. Credits
Comsci was built by Ryan Later and Michael Shuen.
